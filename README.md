# ðŸŒ³ Data Week Competition - CU Boulder: Tree Data Visualization  

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This project was created for the **Data Week Competition at CU Boulder**, where participants analyzed a dataset containing information about trees. The objective was to clean the data and create insightful visualizations to uncover patterns in urban forestry, tree health, and environmental impact.  

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset  
The dataset provided contained various attributes related to trees, including:  
- **Tree Species**  
- **Tree Height & Diameter**  
- **Geolocation Data**  
- **Health Status & Maintenance Needs**  
- **Environmental Benefits**  

ðŸ“„ **Dataset Used:** `Data_Viz_Challenge_2025-UCB_Trees.csv`  

## ðŸ›  Data Processing  
Data cleaning and preprocessing were performed using **Python**, specifically:  
- Removing missing or inconsistent values  
- Standardizing categorical data (e.g., tree species names)  
- Handling outliers in numerical attributes  
- Converting units where necessary  

### ðŸ”§ Technologies Used for Data Cleaning:  
- **Python** (`Pandas`, `NumPy`)  

## ðŸ“Š Data Visualization  
All visualizations were created using **Power BI**, including:  
âœ… **Geospatial Analysis** â€“ Mapping tree locations and density  
âœ… **Tree Health Distribution** â€“ Identifying trees requiring maintenance  
âœ… **Species Diversity Analysis** â€“ Visualizing the most and least common tree species  
âœ… **Environmental Impact Metrics** â€“ Estimating COâ‚‚ absorption and urban cooling effects  
 
## ðŸŽ¯ Future Enhancements  
- Automating data updates with a **Power BI dashboard refresh**  
- Enhancing geospatial analysis with **GIS tools**  
- Integrating **machine learning** for predictive insights on tree health
